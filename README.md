# Todoable

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/todoable`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'todoable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install todoable

## Usage

```ruby
# to start a new session
session = Todoable::Session.new(username, password)

# list actions
session.get_all # retrieve all lists

session.create_list(list: { name: 'list name' }) # create a new list

session.get(:id) # retrieve a list specified by id

session.update(:id, { list: { name: 'new name' } }) # update a specific list name

session.delete_list(:id) # delete a list

# item actions
session.create_item(:list_id, { item: { name: 'item name' } }) # create an item within a specified list

session.complete(:list_id, :item_id) # mark a specified item as complete within the specified list

session.delete_item(:list_id, :id) # delete a specific item in a specific list
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
