# Todoable

Todoable is a gem that allows your app to manage lists and items!

This gem is a very simple wrapper that simplifies calls to the Todoable API by Teachable.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'todoable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install todoable

## Usage

To begin, login to a todoable session by using the following command.

```ruby
session = Todoable::Session.new(your_username, your_password)
```

**Managing Lists**
Here are some of the actions you can take to manage your lists.

```ruby
# returns an array of all the lists belonging to the current user
session.get_all

# returns the attributes of the list specified by id
session.get(:list_id)

# creates a new list, returns the attributes of the created list
session.create_list('list name')

# updates the name of a specific list, returns the updated name
session.update(:list_id, 'new name')

# delete a specific list
session.delete_list(:list_id)
```

**Managing Items**
Here are some of the actions you can take to manage your items.

```ruby
# create an item within a specific list, returns the attributes of the created item
session.create_item(:list_id, 'item name')

# mark a specific item as complete within a specific list
session.complete(:list_id, :item_id)

# delete a specific item in a specific list
session.delete_item(:list_id, :item_id)
```

**Handling Errors**
Any errors returned by the Todoable API will be returned in the response so that you may handle
the error however you please.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version,
update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create
a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
